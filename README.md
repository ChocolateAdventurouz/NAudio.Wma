NAudio.Wma is an extension to [NAudio](http://github.com/NAudio/NAudio) supporting Windows Media Audio files, created by Yuval Naveh.

Please note that you can read and write WMA files using the regular NAudio library using the `MediaFoundationReader` and `MediaFoundationEncoder` classes. This library should be used if you want to use the Windows Media Format SDK functions directly.

It provides a `WmaFileReader` class for reading WMA Files, and a `WmaWriter` class that allows low-level access to the Windows Media Format SDK.
